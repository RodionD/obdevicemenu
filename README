About
----------------------------------------

obdevicemenu is an Openbox pipe menu that uses udisks to easily mount,
unmount or eject removable devices. An extensive configuration file allows
desktop notifications about the success or failure of operations, as well
as the modification of several commands.

    == IMPORTANT ======================================================
    |  The configuration file should be edited first before running.  |
    |  Make sure to always check the configuration file provided in   |
    |  each new release, as some options may be changed or added.     |
    ===================================================================

This script does not provide automounting of removable media as there are
already many ways to automount. The file managers in GNOME and KDE handle
automounting, while udev rules or scripts like Udiskie can be used in other
environments.

bashmount is a similar script that is more versatile and can be used in any
desktop environment or window manager:

Dependencies
----------------------------------------

 * openbox
 * bash
 * dbus
 * udisks
 * notification-daemon (optional)

This script should work on all recent distributions that use udisks. Older
distributions may still be using the deprecated HAL, which is not supported
by obdevicemenu.



Installation
----------------------------------------

1. As root, copy "obdevicemenu" to "/usr/bin" or any other location in $PATH:

      install -m755 obdevicemenu /usr/bin/obdevicemenu

2. Backup any existing configuration files.

3. As root, copy "obdevicemenu.conf" to "/etc/obdevicemenu.conf" for global
   configuration:
	
      install -m644 obdevicemenu.conf /etc/obdevicemenu.conf

4. Optionally, copy "obdevicemenu.conf" to "$HOME/.config/obdevicemenu/config"
   for per-user configuration:

      install -d -m755 ~/.config/obdevicemenu/
      install -m644 obdevicemenu.conf $HOME/.config/obdevicemenu/config

5. Add the following to "$HOME/.config/openbox/menu.xml" in the root-menu
   section:

      <menu id="devices" label="Devices" execute="/usr/bin/obdevicemenu" />

6. Ignore this step if you are using a graphical login manager.

   If you do not use a graphical login manager, consult the documentation
   provided by your distribution on how to run a session with consolekit.
   The following instructions may not work in all distributions.

   Place the following in "$HOME/.xinitrc":

        if test -z "${DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS}"; then
            eval "$(dbus-launch --sh-syntax --exit-with-session)"
        fi
        exec ck-launch-session openbox-session
